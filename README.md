# Peer AMM Curator

A decentralized protocol for curated automated market-making and asset management on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

Peer AMM Curator provides a novel decentralized infrastructure for collaborative asset curation, liquidity provisioning, and market-making. It enables:

- Community-driven asset selection and curation
- Decentralized liquidity pools with dynamic parameters
- Transparent and permissionless market-making mechanisms
- Incentive alignment for liquidity providers and curators
- Flexible trading strategies and risk management

## Architecture

The system leverages a modular contract architecture to enable flexible and secure asset management and market-making.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet
- Stacks wallet
- STX tokens for transactions

### Basic Usage

1. **Propose Asset for Curation**
```clarity
(contract-call? .curator-registry propose-asset
    "Asset Symbol"
    "Asset Name"
    u1000000  ;; Initial valuation
    (list "Tag1" "Tag2"))
```

2. **Provide Liquidity**
```clarity
(contract-call? .amm-pool add-liquidity 
    asset-id 
    u10000)  ;; Liquidity amount
```

3. **Vote on Asset Inclusion**
```clarity
(contract-call? .curator-registry vote-on-asset 
    proposed-asset-id 
    true)  ;; Vote in favor
```

- Gradual decentralization approach
- Dynamic risk management

### Best Practices
- Thorough asset due diligence
- Implement multi-stage validation
- Continuous monitoring of pool dynamics
- Transparent governance processes
